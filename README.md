# ALLFlow

ALLFlow is a note-taking application that operates based on the Zettelkasten method, incorporating brainstorming techniques inspired by Post-it notes.

By utilizing local LLM (Language Model) and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), users can integrate various types of information such as files, emails, and schedules into their knowledge base. This allows for a seamless connection of ideas when drafting new content or progressing through tasks.
